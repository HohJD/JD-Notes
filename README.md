Mobile development 
-Native Apps (Means the code can only apply for one platform, like i write it for Java, can only use for Android, IOS need to write another whole new code)
Android -Java or Kotlin (Language Used)
IOS - Object C and Swift (Language Used)

-Cross Platform Apps / Hybrid Apps (Means the code is applicable for both platforms, Write once, use both.. I can write the code and use on both IOS and Android)
Ionic or Cordova (Old tech) -HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, Angular(Language Used)
Flutter by Google (Framework)-Dart (Language Used)
React Native by Facebook (Framework) - Javascript(Language Used)

-PWA (Progressive Web Apps)
These are quite cool, its like apps but programmed using web development. So the website look like an app, e.g. Pizzahut website. It also uses less internet, e.g. Facebook LITE.

You must be wondering why people still use native apps when cross platform apps seems better? You can go search. In short, native apps have higher performance rate because they only have one platform. But not gonna lie, cross platform apps is getting popular, due to flutter and react native, so better hop on towards that direction.

Backend? 
Means hosting ur apps and all, quite trendy now is Firebase, also by Google. Firebase is 90% same with Google Cloud Platform. Diff is GCP for companies, Firebase for personal projects and startup.

UI/UX?
What is this, it means User interface & User Experience 
Programming side : CSS(Cascading style Sheet), HTML, XML
Non-programming side, Just design, no need to make it out, prototype: Adobe XD, Adobe Illustrator

Web Development
Design websites, dashboard, and all, normally people master both mobile development and Web development together
Code used- HTML, CSS, Javascript

Tech Used Frameworks - Front-End (React, Angular, Vue) These frameworks are basically from Javascript, so can easily learn these frameworks.
                      -Back-End (node.js, python) These are backend tech, not framework. I am not familiar with all these at all..



Cloud Services
Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft Azure

Last time, developers just code and for launching they give it to the operators team to launch the code and maintain the server. But now, the trend is DevOps means Development and Operation can be the same guy. So we GCP, AWS are simple stuffs that programmers can do themselves now. 

Work Platform
How programmers work together? They use git. Git is a version control system, basically like Google Drive for developers. So from Git, the products are Github and Gitlab. There are many more version control system, but these are the famous ones.

Github- Use commands such as push, pull, clone, commit... This one very popular, open source, can find many people projects, can put urs there too as well, 
Gitlab - Company use, codes are only share to developers in company

Cybersecurity
-Mostly python, can find bugs in big company website, firewall protect websites & all.
-Didnt touch much yet, but plan to focus on it one day

Data Science/ Database
Programming language used is R programming and Python
-People normally describe it as db -database
-Google store their data at Data Centre
-SQL (structured query language, means database is structured form, e.g. excel, all word files)
-NoSQL (Non structured, means database in all kind of forms e.g. pdf, jpeg, word.. blablabla

Resources
-Join Student developer club at ur Uni, by Google. Normally learn about Google Tech, such as Flutter, Firebase, GCP, and TensorFLow
-Join any fb groups about all these tech, so you can keep up with the trend
-Use StackOverflow to ask questions
-Read Medium websites(Got App also), full of juice, start-ups and programmers heaven
-How companies, developers communicate Apps(Slack, Discord-Sgt jarang for companies)
-How companies divide task use Scrum method, agile, waterflow model is old trend (ClickUp, Trello)
-Practice coding platforms 
LeetCode (Hard)
Hackerrank(Hard)
Codecamp (Easy, got cert but Java macam xde, only Javascript, HTML, CSS)
Udacity (Easy)
Sololearn (Too easy, only play for fun)
Codelab is the best for Android developing


Trends in 2020 
-AI Chatbots (Python, TensorFlow by Google)
-Interactive Design (UI/UX)
-PWA 
-Cross Platform Apps
-Desktop App (Electron, node js, chromium)
-GraphQL (similar to JSON-Javascript Object Notation)
-Typescript (Angular)
